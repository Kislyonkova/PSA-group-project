# friends.fm
Programming Social Applications course. Repository for our group project.

## about
Our application is created for those who want to explore new music playlists and share it with friends :)

## how to use?
Clone our repo, then simply run `app.py`. Browse our main page, try user search, check some of our users' and playlists' pages!   
**Note:** make sure that you have all required packages *(requirements.txt)*

## Limitations
For now, you can only browse the main page, search for users and check pages of users&playlists.   
In next updates, we will:   
- improve our login/register forms, thus, it will be available to create an account  
- add recommender system  
- update our databases with playlists & content *(content is only default for now)*, and use info from them *(like we do with users)*
